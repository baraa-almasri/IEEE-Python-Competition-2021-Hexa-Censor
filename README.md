# HexaCensor

## What is `HexaCensor`?

`HexaCensor` is a conversation censorship program based on hard to get rhyming

## WHAT? HOW?

`HexaCensor` listens to a conversation and plays a 10s part from a meme song when a curse word is said\
meme songs are the best choice to play, since everybody knows them ***even if they don't have reddit***\
meme songs are literally the best choice because they are:

1. catchy
2. old and familiar
3. sometimes funny

#### so what kind of sorcery is that?

well non, the answer is really simple, someone says a curse word in public, a third-party person or more\
will try to re-hear what that person said, but...
<br>

`HexaCensor` won't let re-hear the curse, because it will go off Rick-Rolling, or playing the USSR anthem\
and the whole place **not just that eavesdropper** will rhyme, sing, or even dance on the played meme song,\
so the thinking of that third-party person will focus on either singing or\
remembering what song was that!(it was a 10s clip from a catchy part) and that third-party person will try to rhyme
until they find the name of that song\
rather than re-hearing the curse, even more people will collaborate, and the whole curse thing will go un-noticed!\
then you have a nice conversation with some memes if someone drops an `f` bomb or any other curse word!
